Suddenly there came a sound of a twig snapping from somewhere nearby in the grove. Edgar froze, wondering what he might do if Mr. Ratikan came out from the shadows again, swinging his walking stick. I should have known he would follow me, Edgar thought with regret.
"You've got twigs and leaves caught in your hair," came a small voice from behind a tree. Edgar felt some initial relief that it wasn't Mr. Ratikan, but he still wasn't altogether happy when he realized who was speaking to him.
"Come out from there, Isabel."
A head of tangled, dirty hair emerged from behind the trunk of the tree, then a brown forehead, and finally a dark eye with a thick black brow hanging over it peered out.
"Did Mr. Ratikan knock you down again? Did he hit you with that awful stick of his?"
As usual, Edgar ignored her questions. "Why must you always follow me, Isabel?" Edgar shook his head back and forth to free the rubbish from his hair, but the twigs and leaves only danced back and forth like little animals clinging to a nest.
"I can get those out for you," said Isabel as she leapt out from behind the tree. She was tiny compared to Edgar, younger and skinny in a way that made Edgar think he might be able to snap her in half if he wanted to. Edgar brushed the leaves and twigs from his mop of brown hair, and then he turned to go.
"Oh, but you can't just go, " said Isabel. "You need to tell me what happened. Did Mr. Ratikan throw you to the ground? Is that why you've got leaves in your hair?"
Edgar was about to scold the girl as an older brother might do when he felt a slight rumbling beneath his feet. Isabel felt it, too, and they both stood quietly, trying to understand what it was. It had happened before --this faint trembling of the ground in the grove --and so the two were not so surprised by it. Still, it was a little stronger this time, as though someone were banging a drum in the ground beneath them, trying to get their attention.
"My father says it's nothing," said Isabel, "but it does feel strange, doesn't it?"
The feeling stopped, and Edgar began to walk away without answering. It was getting late and he still had twenty trees to trim.
"We'll talk tonight at dinner," said Isabel. "Whatever Mr. Ratikan did to you, it'll be our little secret." She ran back into the grove, content for the moment to let her imagination run wild about how Mr. Ratikan had beaten Edgar with his walking stick.

Isabel Is Talkative to Edgar in Line:
Animal bones and parts that weren't eaten or used to create useful items had to be taken to the edge and thrown into the Flatlands along with other debris from Tabletop. But all the work stopped when dinner hour arrived in the grove, and everyone came to Mr. Ratikan's house. Isabel spotted Edgar almost immediately. She waved at him to join her in the line, but Edgar tried to ignore her. Soon she had left her father's side and moved to the back of the line, where she proceeded to bother Edgar immensely with a lot of questions he didn't want to answer.
"That Mr. Ratikan is awful, don't you think? Did you get some water today? I got a little, but hardly any. I wonder what we'll work on tomorrow. Do you think we'll go to the third-year grove? I like the third-year grove best." Isabel talked until the two of them reached the front of the line, and she proceeded to ask some of the same questions of Mr. Ratikan as he rolled his eyes, filled her bowl and cup, and tried to move her along. Mr. Ratikan wouldn't let anyone onto the steps that led to a tiny porch in front of his door, for entering his house was forbidden. This made it difficult for him to get rid of Isabel without picking up his walking stick and waving it at her.
"Why must you always try to hit people with that horrible stick of yours?" said Isabel, her dark eyebrows set in a scowl. Mr. Ratikan responded by pinching his face in such a ghastly expression that Isabel snatched her cup and bowl and scurried away from the house.

Isabel Slings Edgar:
As he neared the end of the last row of saplings, Edgar snapped out of his reverie when he heard a crack and something shot just a hair past his head. He ducked and instantly reached for his sling.
"I saw you."

Edgar spun around and saw Isabel standing about ten paces away, reloading from a little bag full of black figs hanging  around her waist. She began swinging the sling once more, and Edgar froze. She let one end of the string go with a pop, and and other black fig flew a few inches over Edgar's head.
"You've gone mad!" he screamed, fumbling in his side pocket to seize his own weapon. But Isabel had already reloaded and was swirling another black fig over her head. She was unbelievably swift in her movements.
"I followed you before dinner last night," she said. "I saw what you did."
"I don't know what you're talking about," said Edgar, loading his sling. "Put that thing down!"
"I know where you went and what you were doing." She let go of the string once more with a snap, and this time the black fig nearly grazed the right side of Edgar's head. "I've always known."
Always known? Could it be true? And when had she made the sling? Edgar didn't think anyone else had thought to make one, and certainly not Isabel. It was clear she had mastered its use. She could aim it and throw with force.
"We can't talk if you keep throwing those things at me," said Edgar.
"I wasn't going to hit you," she said. "I've better aim than you and I can throw a black fig farther. Do you want to know why? Because I spend my time practicing while you climb around trying to get yourself killed!"
Now Edgar was angry. Who did this nine-year-old girl think she was, following him around and spying on him day and night? He would show her how wrong she was.
Edgar loaded a black fig into his sling and began swinging it over his head.
"Do you see that second-year tree down the line, the one on the very end?"
Isabel nodded. It was a long way off down a narrow path through the trees. Edgar's black fig whizzed through the air down the path and glanced off the trunk. Not a direct hit, but a hit nonetheless on a target so far away Isabel could never hit it.
"I don't know what it is you're doing climbing around up there," she said, fishing around for a fig in her little bag. "It's dangerous! And it's against the rules --I mean the really big rules, the ones you can't break or they take you away."
"Why must you always sneak around?" said Edgar. His secret was known by someone --and not just any someone. It was Isabel!
She stepped closer to Edgar and began swinging the black fig in a wide circle over her head. Edgar realized for the first time that her sling was longer than his, quite a bit longer. Around and around it went, gaining speed and force. When Isabel let it go, Edgar was astounded to see that it plainly traveled much faster than Edgar's had. And not only that, but it hit the very center of the second-year tree that his had only glanced. It was true. Isabel was a better shot than he was. And she probably could hurl a black fig farther than he could, too.
"A long time ago I watched you make a sling, so I made one, too."
Edgar didn't know what to think. He showed no emotion ï¿½only a blank stare --which wasn't surprising, having had no sleep or
water or food for so long.
Isabel stood before him, her anger having turned to concern.
"Last night, when you didn't return for so very long --" Isabel
broke off, embarrassed, and tried to find the right words. "I
thought you were never coming back."
Edgar was finally beginning to understand that he'd spent so
much energy trying to keep people away for such a long time --to remain hidden --that he hadn't realized Isabel's true
intentions. She wanted only to be his friend. And yet he was still
angry.
"I don't trust anyone," said Edgar. "And I'm afraid you'll tell
someone."
Isabel turned and scampered off into the trees a short distance
away. When she returned, she held out a handful of dough and
a cup of water to Edgar. Isabel had come to him at his weakest,
and he couldn't resist reaching for it.
"Why must you climb the cliffs when you know it's forbidden?"
Isabel asked, pulling the dough and the water back so Edgar
couldn't reach it.
"I can't tell you."
The two were at a standoff. They were like two lonely saplings
standing near one another, rooted to the ground, unable to
come any closer.
"I have my reasons for climbing the cliffs," said Edgar. "I can't
tell you what they are, only that they are very important."
Isabel's dark eyebrows were her most expressive feature, and
they moved up just a little, which told Edgar she wished he
would go on. When Edgar had nothing more to offer, Isabel
relented and handed over the dough and water.


"I won't tell anyone what you're doing, I promise I won't. And
we'll never be friends if I keep sneaking around trying to
understand you, so I won't do it anymore."
Edgar gulped some water and swallowed a hunk of the dough,
barely chewing it. He'd always been alone, but now found
himself with Isabel and Samuel --two allies where before he'd
had none. The speed at which things were moving made him
nervous, and yet the idea of having companions he could trust
captivated him.
"There's been a lot of talk in the grove these past few days,"
said Isabel.
Edgar looked up nervously, wondering if word of his climbing
had gotten out.
"Oh, no --they don't know anything about the climbing," Isabel
reassured him, as if reading his mind.
"What, then?"
"Remember when the ground shook yesterday and the day
before that?" Edgar nodded.
"People are scared. The adults gathered in the village last
night, but I couldn't get close enough to hear them. They're
preparing for something. And that man, do you remember him,
the one who was sick at dinner the other night?"
Edgar nodded again. "Well, he's still sick. From what I've
overheard, he hasn't eaten or been back to work. He just lies in
bed moaning. People are nervous about it. They think maybe it
was something in the grove that caused it."
"You mean something he ate?"
Isabel shrugged. "I don't know." "Well, it doesn't have anything
to do with us," Edgar said, changing the subject. The water and
food were clearing his head, and there was a little more energy
in his legs. "In a couple of nights I have to go somewhere. Do
you think you could do something for me?"
Isabel's eyebrows darted up. Maybe he had decided to trust her
after all.
"Tomorrow night, if I'm up to it, I'll be traveling to the Village of
Rabbits on an important errand. I could use some food and
water for the journey. Do you think you could get anything for
me?"
"I can always get more than I need."
Her reply made Edgar realize once again that he had long
underestimated the cleverness of this girl of the grove.
"You know where I usually sleep, on the far side of the main
grove?" Isabel nodded.
"Can you meet me there in the morning with something to eat,
and again after dinner?"
"I can."
Edgar ate the last of the dough and drank what was left in the
cup, then handed the cup back to Isabel. The two of them
parted ways. Isabel walked toward Mr. Ratikan's house and
Edgar went the other way, to the place where he slept.
Not long after, Edgar heard the snap of a sling and ducked
down in the grove. A black fig slammed into a tree beside him
and bounced along the ground at Edgar's feet. When he looked
back there was no one, only the trees of the grove and the
sound of a girl laughing in the distance.
